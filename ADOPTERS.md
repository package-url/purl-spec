# Adopters

PURL (Package-URL) - [ECMA-427](https://ecma-tc54.github.io/ECMA-427/) - has been adopted by other specifications and is supported by many tools. The details are available on the [Package-URL website](https://www.packageurl.org/).

- See [Specifications](https://www.packageurl.org/#:~:text=PURL%20Adoption%20%2D%20Specifications) 
for the list of these specifications.
- See [Tools](https://www.packageurl.org/#:~:text=PURL%20v1.0-,Software%20Tools) for the list of these tools.

If you want to add a tool or specification that supports PURL please create an issue in the [Package-URL website repostory](https://github.com/package-url/www.packageurl.org/issues). 
There are separate issue templates for 'Add a Tool' and 'Add a Specification" 
because the data fields are different.

**NB** There is a "staging website" for Package-URL at: https://package-url.github.io/www.packageurl.org/ 
that will have the most recent information about specifications and tools 
that have adopted PURL. We normally update the "production" website at:
 https://www.packageurl.org/ weekly.
