generic
-------
``generic`` for plain, generic packages that do not fit anywhere else such as
for "upstream-from-distro" packages. In particular this is handy for a plain
version control repository such as a bare git repo.

- There is no default repository. A ``download_url`` and ``checksum`` may be
  provided in `qualifiers` or as separate attributes outside of a ``purl`` for
  proper identification and location.
- When possible another or a new purl ``type`` should be used instead of using
  the ``generic`` type and eventually contributed back to this specification.
- as for other ``type``, the ``name`` component is mandatory. In the worst case
  it can be a file or directory name.
- Examples (truncated for brevity)::

      pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.10g
      pkg:generic/openssl@1.1.10g?download_url=https://openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.0g.tar.gz&checksum=sha256:de4d501267da
      pkg:generic/bitwarderl?vcs_url=git%2Bhttps://git.fsfe.org/dxtr/bitwarderl%40cc55108da32
