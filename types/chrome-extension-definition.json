  "description": "Chrome Browser Extensions. Note: there are currently no officially documented APIs, further there appears to be no way to query different versions of a package - there only seems to be responses on the latest version. To this end the version component of a chrome purl can be optional. Two known data sources are a sitemap which can be crawled to discover (some) extensions at https://chromewebstore.google.com/sitemap, and an 'updatecheck' API which you can read about here https://github.com/Rob--W/crxviewer , and perhaps here https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/docs/updater/protocol_3_1.md",
