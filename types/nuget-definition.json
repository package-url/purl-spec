      "description": "``.nupkg`` files have attached signatures:\ninside the package file, there is a signature file which signs the package content.\nNot only can NuGet authors sign packages,\nbut NuGet repositories often sign every package within the repository.\nNuGet.org applies repository signatures,\nso it is very common for a ``.nupkg`` file to contain a repository signature.\n\nThe NuGet tooling does not consider this signature file to be part of the package.\nWhen the NuGet tooling generates an SHA-512 hash of a package,\ne.g. in a ``project.assets.json`` file or ``packages.lock.json`` file,\nthat SHA-512 package hash is the hash of the ``.nupkg`` file with the ``signature.p7s`` removed.\nThis allows additional signatures to be added to the package after it has been published,\nwithout creating a distinct package that would be rejected by an existing ``packages.lock.json`` file.\n\nWhen generating a ``checksum`` qualifier for a NuGet dependency,\nNuGet's package SHA-512 should not be used.\nInstead, use the SHA-512 hash of the package file.\nThis maintains a consistent meaning of the ``checksum`` qualifier across different package types."
