## Notes
- Meeting minutes are being kept and will be published, but the meeting is not being recorded.
- Our code of conduct (link in agenda above) applies to this meeting.
- Philippe, Martin and John reviewed the 'scheme' and 'type' PRs in detail.
    - Discussion of using negatives like NOT in the spec â€“ when used sparingly, NOT is clearer and more concise than rewording to avoid the term.
    - Consider whether, and if so how, to address encoding in the spec, e.g., streamline or remove the "Character encoding" section and address encoding in the "How to parse a purl string in its components" section, with details in the FAQ.
    - Martin will explore how the draft FAQ can be improved, perhaps converting it to a cleaner, more concise set of clarifications rather than the current question/answer structure.
    - John will clean up the draft FAQ in the 'scheme' and 'type' PRs to remove placeholder entries, update the test-suite-data.json file as needed for the 'type' PR, implement the various suggested changes for the 'scheme' and 'type' PRs, and then turn to the 'qualifiers' update.

- The meeting was adjourned.
