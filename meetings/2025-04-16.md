## Notes
- Meeting minutes are being kept and will be published, but the meeting is not being recorded.
- Our code of conduct (link in agenda above) applies to this meeting.
- Introductions.
- Additional agenda items:
    - Joshua: nothing in particular
    - Martin: percent-encoding of qualifiers in packageurl-python implementation
    - John: issue/PR status
    - Michael: milestones, actual spec target document structure
    - Jan: milestones, subpath issue he had to reopen for related issues
    - George: just observing
    - Philippe: recent developments
- Philippe:
    - Summarized developments at conferences he attended last week; lots of interest, discussions re PURLs.
    - CVE/MITRE funding status.  Martin: situation less alarming than some might think – CVE Program exists regardless of particular MITRE funding questions, and new initiatives are being explored.  CVE is a global, not exclusively American, program, with many CNAs and other interested parties around the globe.  Philippe: idea re spec similar to PURL but for vulnerabilities.  Martin: might fragment the ecosystem.  Why not use a VEX standard instead?
- Martin: Questions re encoding and qualifiers.  Test suite and libraries do not follow the encoding spec.  Questions include whether the colon ':' must be percent-encoded, which Martin understood was the case.  John: the last encoding update expressly provides that "all characters MUST be encoded except for the colon ':'."
- John: Brief update on recent progress.
- Martin: Brief overview of VulnCon last week.  Software ID was an active topic.  He gave a PURL presentation, will share link when available.  C/C++ standardization needs attention.  Philippe agrees.
- Jan: Questions re the subpath tickets under the newly-reopened parent issue https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/379.
    - One topic: PR 458 (https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/458) – don't limit path delimiters to the slash '/' – there are other path delimiters.  (See, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing).)  Philippe: thinks this was not supported before, just POSIX, could introduce problems.  Jan: question is how to craft the subpath, and wants to point out there are more delimiters than just the slash '/'.  Joshua: understands that Python, for example, assigns the correct subpath delimiter behind the scenes.  Detailed discussion ensued.  We'll continue this discussion offline.
    - Next: PR 449 (https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/449) was discussed.  Philippe: will think about these two PRs together.  These might raise more questions than they clarify.  The clarity of POSIX is very appealing.
- Jan: Re the 1.0-draft milestone – proposes that this not include type-related issues/PRs.
    - Michael: yes, makes sense, and he has drafted a document to help organize the issues/PRs.  Michael summarized his proposal re core-spec vs. PURL types including perhaps a minimal spec for types.
    - Philippe: that is consistent with Steve's proposal re a JSON Schema that would address types.  (See https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/401.)
    - In addition, Michael will adapt the CycloneDX document to our PURL work to provide an initial sense of the structure and will share his work when ready.
    - Philippe: see also Steve's example at  https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/ECMA-xxx-PURL.
- The meeting was adjourned.
