## Case folding

References to "lowercase" in this specification refer to the **culture-invariant**
full case mapping defined in
[Section 3.13.2 of the Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-3/#G34078).

When applied to the ASCII character set, this operation converts uppercase
Latin letters (``A to Z``) to their corresponding lowercase forms (``a to z``).
All other ASCII characters remain unchanged.
