# Package-URL Specification

The Package URL core specification defines a versioned and formalized format,
syntax, and rules used to represent and validate `purl`.

A `purl` or package URL is an attempt to standardize existing approaches to
reliably identify and locate software packages.

A `purl` is a URL string used to identify and locate a software package in a
mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers,
packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.

A `purl` is useful to reliably reference the same software package
using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.


The Package-URL specification is organized in these documents:

- Rules for each `purl` component -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/standard/components.md
- Character encoding -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/standard/characters-and-encoding.md
- How to build a `purl` string from its components -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/how-to-build.md
- How to parse a `purl` string into its components -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/how-to-parse.md
- Known `purl` `qualifiers` key/value pairs -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/known-qualifiers.md
