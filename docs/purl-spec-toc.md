# Package-URL Specification

Package-URL ``purl`` is a URL string used to identify and locate a software
package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages,
package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases. A ``purl``
is useful to reliably reference a software package using a simple and
expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.

The current Package-URL specification is currently organized in the the following documents:

- ``purl`` stands for package URL -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/ecma/specification.md
- Some ``purl`` examples -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/purl-examples.md
- A ``purl`` is a URL -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/ecma/purl-url.md
- Rules for each ``purl`` component -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/ecma/component-level-rules.md
- Permitted characters -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/ecma/permitted-characters.md
- Separators -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/ecma/separator-characters.md
- Character encoding -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob//ecma/character-encoding.md
- Case folding -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/ecma/case-folding.md
- How to build a ``purl`` string from its components -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/build-purl.md
- How to parse a ``purl`` string into its components -- https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/docs/parse-purl.md
