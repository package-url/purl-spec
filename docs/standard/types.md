## Package-URL type definitions

Each package manager, platform, type, or ecosystem has its own conventions
and protocols to identify, locate, and provision software packages.

The package `type` is the component of a Package-URL that is used to
capture this information with a short string such as `maven`, `npm`,
`nuget`, `gem`, `pypi`, etc.

PURL type definitions are maintained in a set of JSON Schema files with a
separate file for each `purl` `type`. Each `purl` `type` has a corresponding
file of automatically generated documentation. There is also a simple index
of all currently registered purl types.
