## Package-URL type definitions

Each package manager, platform, type, or ecosystem has its own conventions
and protocols to identify, locate, and provision software packages.

The package **type** is the component of a Package-URL that is used to
capture this information with a short string such as `maven`, `npm`,
`nuget`, `gem`, `pypi`, etc.

These are registered PURL package type definitions.

Definitions can also include types reserved for future use.

This document no longer contains a manually maintained list of PURL types.

Instead, all PURL type definitions are now maintained in a simple JSON
document with automatically generated documentation.

## Where to find PURL Type information

- In the JSON Index listing of all defined PURL types at:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/purl-types-index.json

- In individual JSON files, one for each PURL type definition at:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/types

- As Markdown documentation, generated from for each PURL type JSON
  definition at:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/types-doc
