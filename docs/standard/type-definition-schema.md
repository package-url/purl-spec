# Package-URL Type Definition Schema

The PURL Type Definition JSON Schema is the reference data model that is used 
to define PURL types in a structured way. Each PURL type is specified in a 
JSON document that matches this schema. These JSON documents are then used to 
generate PURL type documentation and to support PURL libraries and tools so 
that they can more easily parse, build, and validate PURLs by type in a 
consistent and standardized manner across programing languages and technology 
stacks.
