# 4 Overview

This section contains a non-normative overview of the Package-URL specification.

The Package-URL (PURL) specification defines a lightweight, universal syntax for identifying software packages. By leveraging a URL-based format, PURL provides a consistent and interoperable mechanism for referencing software packages across a wide range of ecosystems and tools. Its design addresses the challenges of ambiguity, inconsistency, and fragmentation in software package identification, enabling better interoperability and traceability in modern software supply chains.

This specification focuses on the core aspects of PURL, including its syntax, required components, optional attributes, and conformance requirements. It does not cover ecosystem-specific types or extensions such as PURL Version Ranges (VERS). However, the flexibility of PURL allows it to be extended to meet the needs of diverse package ecosystems without compromising its universal applicability.

The primary audience for this specification includes developers, tool implementers, and organisations involved in software composition analysis, dependency management, and supply chain security. PURL is foundational to a variety of use cases, from software bill of materials (SBOM) generation and license compliance to vulnerability tracking and software artifact exchange.

While this document serves as the authoritative reference for implementing PURL, it is complemented by various ecosystem-specific guidance documents, examples, and related standards. These resources provide additional context and practical insights for leveraging PURL effectively.

This overview is non-normative and serves to provide context for the specificationâ€™s intent, purpose, and audience. For detailed requirements and conformance criteria, refer to the normative sections of this specification.
