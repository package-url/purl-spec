# Introduction

Software ecosystems have evolved into highly interconnected networks of
components, packages, and dependencies. Managing this complexity demands
a robust, uniform mechanism to identify and track software packages
across diverse ecosystems and tools. Package-URL (PURL) was developed to
address this challenge by providing a simple, consistent, and flexible
approach to identifying software packages with precision and clarity.

PURL introduces a standardized URL-based syntax that uniquely identifies
software packages, independent of their ecosystem or distribution
channel. Unlike traditional identification methods, PURL embeds critical
metadata directly into its structure, enabling efficient, accurate
package identification at scale. This standardization ensures
interoperability between tools and ecosystems, fostering greater
collaboration and reducing ambiguity in software supply chain
management.

Challenges addressed by PURL:

- **Ambiguity in Package Identification:** With diverse naming
  conventions across ecosystems, identifying software packages reliably
  has historically been a challenge. PURL eliminates this ambiguity by
  creating a universal identifier with a predictable structure.
- **Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability:** Developers, organizations, and
  tools often work across multiple ecosystems, each with its own package
  management systems. PURL harmonizes these differences, enabling
  seamless interoperability.
- **Enhanced Traceability and Risk Management:** In an era where supply
  chain security is critical, PURL provides the foundation for
  identifying and tracing packages to their origins, dependencies, and
  potential vulnerabilities.
- **Tooling and Automation:** By standardizing package identification,
  PURL simplifies tooling development, automation, and integration for
  tasks such as software composition analysis, vulnerability management,
  and license compliance.

As software supply chain security becomes a global priority, formalizing
PURL as an international standard ensures its adoption and consistent
implementation. Standardization under Ecma International Technical
Committee 54 (TC54) positions PURL as a foundational building block for
secure, transparent, and efficient software ecosystems worldwide.

By enabling a universally recognized and implementable specification,
PURL aligns with global efforts to improve the security, reliability,
and accountability of software supply chains. Its adoption ensures that
organizations and developers can rely on a common language to manage
software packages across the diverse and rapidly evolving software
landscape.

## What is a `purl`?

`purl` stands for **package URL**.

A `purl` is a URL composed of seven components:

    scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath

Components are separated by a specific character for unambiguous
parsing.

The definition for each component is:

- **scheme**: this is the URL scheme with the constant value of “pkg”.
  One of the primary reason for this single scheme is to facilitate the
  future official registration of the “pkg” scheme for package URLs.
  Required.
- **type**: the package “type” or package “protocol” such as maven, npm,
  nuget, gem, pypi, etc. Required.
- **namespace**: some name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a Docker
  image owner, a GitHub user or organization. Optional and
  type-specific.
- **name**: the name of the package. Required.
- **version**: the version of the package. Optional.
- **qualifiers**: extra qualifying data for a package such as an OS,
  architecture, a distro, etc. Optional and type-specific.
- **subpath**: extra subpath within a package, relative to the package
  root. Optional.

Table 1: Components of a PURL

| Component | Requirement | Description |
|----|----|:---|
| scheme | Required | The URL scheme with the constant value of “pkg”. One of the primary reasons for this single scheme is to facilitate the future official registration of the “pkg” scheme for package URLs. |
| type | Required | The package “type” or package “protocol” such as maven, npm, nuget, gem, pypi, etc. |
| namespace | Optional | A name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a Docker image owner, a GitHub user or organization. Namespace is type-specific. |
| name | Required | The name of the package. |
| version | Optional | The version of the package. |
| qualifiers | Optional | Qualifier data for a package such as OS, architecture, repository, etc. Qualifiers are type-specific. |
| subpath | Optional | Subpath within a package, relative to the package root. |

Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most
significant on the left to the least significant components on the
right.

A `purl` must not contain a URL Authority, i.e. there is no support for
`username`, `password`, `host` and `port` components. A `namespace`
segment may sometimes look like a `host`, but its interpretation is
specific to a `type`.

## A `purl` is a URL

- A `purl` is a valid URL and URI that conforms to the URL definitions
  or specifications at:

  - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax
  - https://url.spec.whatwg.org/

- This is a valid URL because it is a locator even though it has no
  Authority URL component: each `type` has a default repository location
  when defined.

- The `purl` components are mapped to these URL components:

  - `purl` `scheme`: this is a URL `scheme` with a constant value: `pkg`
  - `purl` `type`, `namespace`, `name` and `version` components: these
    are collectively mapped to a URL `path`
  - `purl` `qualifiers`: this maps to a URL `query`
  - `purl` `subpath`: this is a URL `fragment`
  - In a `purl`, there is no support for a URL Authority (e.g. no
    `username`, `password`, `host` and `port` components).

- Special URL schemes as defined in https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ such as
  `file://`, `https://`, `http://` and `ftp://` are not valid `purl`
  types. They are valid URL or URI schemes but they are not `purl`. They
  may be used to reference URLs in separate attributes outside of a
  `purl` or in a `purl` qualifier.

- Version control system (VCS) URLs such `git://`, `svn://`, `hg://` or
  as defined in Python pip or SPDX download locations are not valid
  `purl` types. They are valid URL or URI schemes but they are not
  `purl`. They are a closely related, compact and uniform way to
  reference VCS URLs. They may be used as references in separate
  attributes outside of a `purl` or in a `purl` qualifier.

## Rules for each `purl` component

A `purl` string is an ASCII URL string composed of seven components.

Except as expressly stated otherwise in this section, each component:

- May be composed of any of the characters defined in the “Permitted
  characters” section
- Must be encoded as defined in the “Character encoding” section

The “lowercase” rules are defined in the “Case folding” section.

The rules for each component are:

- **scheme**:

  - The `scheme` is a constant with the value “pkg”.
  - The `scheme` must be followed by an unencoded colon ‘:’.
  - `purl` parsers must accept URLs where the `scheme` and colon ‘:’ are
    followed by one or more slash ‘/’ characters, such as ‘pkg://’, and
    must ignore and remove all such ‘/’ characters.

- **type**:

  - The package `type` must be composed only of ASCII letters and
    numbers, period ‘.’, and dash ‘-’.
  - The `type` must start with an ASCII letter.
  - The `type` must not be percent-encoded.
  - The `type` is case insensitive. The canonical form is lowercase.

- **namespace**:

  - The `namespace` is optional, unless required by the package’s `type`
    definition.

  - If present, the `namespace` may contain one or more segments,
    separated by a single unencoded slash ‘/’ character.

  - All leading and trailing slashes ‘/’ are not significant and should
    be stripped in the canonical form. They are not part of the
    `namespace`.

  - Each `namespace` segment must be a percent-encoded string.

  - When percent-decoded, a segment:

    - Must not contain any slash ‘/’ characters
    - Must not be empty
    - Must contain any Unicode character other than ‘/’ unless the
      package’s `type` definition provides otherwise.

  - A URL host or Authority must not be used as a `namespace`. Use
    instead a `repository_url` qualifier. Note however, that for some
    types, the `namespace` may look like a host.

- **name**:

  - The `name` is prefixed by a single slash ‘/’ separator when the
    `namespace` is not empty.
  - All leading and trailing slashes ‘/’ are not significant and should
    be stripped in the canonical form. They are not part of the `name`.
  - A `name` must be a percent-encoded string.
  - When percent-decoded, a `name` may contain any Unicode character
    unless the package’s `type` definition provides otherwise.

- **version**:

  - The `version` is prefixed by a ‘@’ separator when not empty.
  - This ‘@’ is not part of the `version`.
  - A `version` must be a percent-encoded string.
  - When percent-decoded, a `version` may contain any Unicode character
    unless the package’s `type` definition provides otherwise.
  - A `version` is a plain and opaque string.

- **qualifiers**:

  - The `qualifiers` component must be prefixed by an unencoded question
    mark ‘?’ separator when not empty. This ‘?’ separator is not part of
    the `qualifiers` component.

  - The `qualifiers` component is composed of one or more `key=value`
    pairs. Multiple `key=value` pairs must be separated by an unencoded
    ampersand ‘&’. This ‘&’ separator is not part of an individual
    `qualifier`.

  - A `key` and `value` must be separated by the unencoded equal sign
    ‘=’ character. This ‘=’ separator is not part of the `key` or
    `value`.

  - A `value` must not be an empty string: a `key=value` pair with an
    empty `value` is the same as if no `key=value` pair exists for this
    `key`.

  - For each `key=value` pair:

    - The `key` must be composed only of lowercase ASCII letters and
      numbers, period ‘.’, dash ‘-’ and underscore ’\_’.
    - A `key` must start with an ASCII letter.
    - A `key` must not be percent-encoded.
    - Each `key` must be unique among all the keys of the `qualifiers`
      component.
    - A `value` may contain any Unicode character and all characters
      must be encoded as described in the “Character encoding” section.

- **subpath**:

  - The `subpath` string is prefixed by a ‘\#’ separator when not empty

  - This ‘\#’ is not part of the `subpath`

  - The `subpath` contains zero or more segments, separated by slash ‘/’

  - Leading and trailing slashes ‘/’ are not significant and should be
    stripped in the canonical form

  - Each `subpath` segment must be a percent-encoded string

  - When percent-decoded, a segment:

    - Must not contain any slash ‘/’ characters
    - Must not be empty
    - Must not be any of ‘..’ or ‘.’
    - May contain any Unicode character other than ‘/’ unless the
      package’s `type` definition provides otherwise.

  - The `subpath` must be interpreted as relative to the root of the
    package

## Permitted characters

A canonical `purl` is composed of these permitted ASCII characters:

- the Alphanumeric Characters: `A to Z`, `a to z`, `0 to 9`,
- the Punctuation Characters: `.-_~` (period ‘.’, dash ‘-’, underscore
  ’\_’ and tilde ‘~’),
- the Percent Character: `%` (percent sign ‘%’), and
- the Separator Characters `:/@?=&#` (colon ‘:’, slash ‘/’, at sign ‘@’,
  question mark ‘?’, equal sign ‘=’, ampersand ‘&’ and hash sign ‘\#’).

## Separators

This is how each of the Separator Characters is used:

- ‘:’ (colon) is the separator between `scheme` and `type`
- ‘/’ (slash) is the separator between `type`, `namespace` and `name`
- ‘/’ (slash) is the separator between `subpath` segments
- ‘@’ (at sign) is the separator between `name` and `version`
- ‘?’ (question mark) is the separator before `qualifiers`
- ‘=’ (equals) is the separator between a `key` and a `value` of a
  `qualifier`
- ‘&’ (ampersand) is the separator between `qualifiers` (each being a
  `key=value` pair)
- ‘\#’ (number sign) is the separator before `subpath`

## Character encoding

- In the “Rules for each `purl` component” section, each component
  defines when and how to apply percent-encoding and decoding to its
  content.

- When percent-encoding is required by a component definition, the
  component string must first be encoded as UTF-8.

- In the component string, each “data octet” must be replaced by the
  percent-encoded “character triplet” applying the percent-encoding
  mechanism defined in [RFC 3986 section
  2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1),
  including the RFC definition of “data octet” and “character triplet”,
  and using these definitions for RFC’s “allowed set” and “delimiters”:

  - “allowed set” is composed of the Alphanumeric Characters and the
    Punctuation Characters
  - “delimiters” is composed of the Separator Characters

- The following characters must not be percent-encoded:

  - the Alphanumeric Characters,
  - the Punctuation Characters,
  - the Separator Characters when being used as `purl` separators,
  - the colon ‘:’, whether used as a Separator Character or otherwise,
    and
  - the percent sign ‘%’ when used to represent a percent-encoded
    character.

- Where the space ’ ’ is permitted, it must be percent-encoded as ‘%20’.

- With the exception of the percent-encoding mechanism, the rules
  regarding percent-encoding are defined by this specification alone.

## Case folding

References to “lowercase” in this specification refer to the
**culture-invariant** full case mapping defined in [Section 3.13.2 of
the Unicode
Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-3/#G34078).

When applied to the ASCII character set, this operation converts
uppercase Latin letters (`A to Z`) to their corresponding lowercase
forms (`a to z`). All other ASCII characters remain unchanged.

## Package-URL Type definitions

Each package manager, platform, type, or ecosystem has its own
conventions and protocols to identify, locate, and provision software
packages.

The package `type` is the component of a Package-URL that is used to
capture this information with a short string such as `maven`, `npm`,
`nuget`, `gem`, `pypi`, etc.

PURL type definitions are maintained in a set of JSON Schema files with
a separate file for each `purl` `type`. Each `purl` `type` has a
corresponding file of automatically generated documentation. There is
also a simple index of all currently registered purl types.

## Where to find PURL type information

- In individual JSON files, one for each `purl` `type` definition at:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/types

- As Markdown documentation, generated from each `purl` `type` JSON
  definition at:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/types-doc

- In the JSON Index listing of all registered PURL types at:
  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/purl-types-index.json

## How PURL Types are maintained

PURL type definitions are maintained as JSON definition files and JSON
test files in the PURL specification repository. These JSON files serve
as the source of truth and define the structure of each PURL type,
including:

- Namespace and name formatting rules
- Supported qualifiers
- Repository requirements
- Mapping of PURL concepts to the native ecosystem concepts

On commit, a job automatically:

- Checks that all JSON files are schema-valid
- Formats all the JSON files
- Generates the `purl-types-index.json` file containing a list of
  defined registered PURL types
- Generates human-readable documentation for each type

## How to Propose a New PURL Type

To propose a new PURL type, create an **issue** and a corresponding
**pull request** in the repository with:

- a new JSON definition file under `types/`.
- a new JSON test file file under `tests/types/`.

Ensure that your proposal follows the **PURL Type Definition Schema**
and includes all required fields. For this see the README-dev.md for
details to run local checks.

## How to build a `purl` string from its components

Building a `purl` ASCII string works from left to right, from `type` to
`subpath`.

Note: some extra type-specific normalizations are required. See the
“Registered types section” for details.

To build a `purl` string from its components:

- Start a `purl` string with the “pkg:” `scheme` as a lowercase ASCII
  string

- Append the `type` string to the `purl` as an unencoded lowercase ASCII
  string

  - Append ‘/’ to the `purl`

- If the `namespace` is not empty:

  - Strip the `namespace` from leading and trailing ‘/’
  - Split on ‘/’ as segments
  - Apply type-specific normalization to each segment if needed
  - UTF-8-encode each segment if needed in your programming language
  - Percent-encode each segment
  - Join the segments with ‘/’
  - Append this to the `purl`
  - Append ‘/’ to the `purl`
  - Strip the `name` from leading and trailing ‘/’
  - Apply type-specific normalization to the `name` if needed
  - UTF-8-encode the `name` if needed in your programming language
  - Append the percent-encoded `name` to the `purl`

- If the `namespace` is empty:

  - Apply type-specific normalization to the `name` if needed
  - UTF-8-encode the `name` if needed in your programming language
  - Append the percent-encoded `name` to the `purl`

- If the `version` is not empty:

  - Append ‘@’ to the `purl`
  - UTF-8-encode the `version` if needed in your programming language
  - Append the percent-encoded version to the `purl`

- If the `qualifiers` are not empty and not composed only of key/value
  pairs where the `value` is empty:

  - Append ‘?’ to the `purl`

  - Build a list from all key/value pair:

    - Discard any pair where the `value` is empty.
    - UTF-8-encode each `value` if needed in your programming language
    - If the `key` is `checksum` and this is a list of checksums join
      this list with a ‘,’ to create this qualifier `value`
    - Create a string by joining the lowercased `key`, the equal ‘=’
      sign and the percent-encoded `value` to create a qualifier

  - Sort this list of qualifier strings lexicographically

  - Join this list of qualifier strings with a ‘&’ ampersand

  - Append this string to the `purl`

- If the `subpath` is not empty and not composed only of empty, ‘.’ and
  ‘..’ segments:

  - Append ‘\#’ to the `purl`
  - Strip the `subpath` from leading and trailing ‘/’
  - Split this on ‘/’ as segments
  - Discard empty, ‘.’ and ‘..’ segments
  - Percent-encode each segment
  - UTF-8-encode each segment if needed in your programming language
  - Join the segments with ‘/’
  - Append this to the `purl`

## How to parse a `purl` string into its components

Parsing a `purl` ASCII string into its components works from right to
left, from `subpath` to `type`.

Note: some extra type-specific normalizations are required. See the
“Registered types section” for details.

To parse a `purl` string in its components:

- Split the `purl` string once from right on ‘\#’

  - The left side is the `remainder`
  - Strip the right side from leading and trailing ‘/’
  - Split this on ‘/’
  - Discard any empty string segment from that split
  - Percent-decode each segment
  - Discard any ‘.’ or ‘..’ segment from that split
  - UTF-8-decode each segment if needed in your programming language
  - Join segments back with a ‘/’
  - This is the `subpath`

- Split the `remainder` once from right on ‘?’

  - The left side is the `remainder`

  - The right side is the `qualifiers` string

  - Split the `qualifiers` on ‘&’. Each part is a `key=value` pair

  - For each pair, split the `key=value` once from left on ‘=’:

    - The `key` is the lowercase left side
    - The `value` is the percent-decoded right side
    - UTF-8-decode the `value` if needed in your programming language
    - Discard any key/value pairs where the value is empty
    - If the `key` is `checksum`, split the `value` on ‘,’ to create a
      list of checksums

  - This list of key/value is the `qualifiers` object

- Split the `remainder` once from left on ‘:’

  - The left side lowercased is the `scheme`
  - The right side is the `remainder`

- Strip all leading ‘/’ characters (e.g., ‘/’, ‘//’, ‘///’ and so on)
  from the `remainder`

  - Split this once from left on ‘/’
  - The left side lowercased is the `type`
  - The right side is the `remainder`

- Split the `remainder` once from right on ‘@’

  - The left side is the `remainder`
  - Percent-decode the right side. This is the `version`.
  - UTF-8-decode the `version` if needed in your programming language
  - This is the `version`

- Strip all trailing ‘/’ characters (e.g., ‘/’, ‘//’, ‘///’ and so on)
  from the `remainder`

  - Split this once from right on ‘/’
  - The left side is the `remainder`
  - Percent-decode the right side. This is the `name`
  - UTF-8-decode this `name` if needed in your programming language
  - Apply type-specific normalization to the `name` if needed
  - This is the `name`

- Split the `remainder` on ‘/’

  - Discard any empty segment from that split
  - Percent-decode each segment
  - UTF-8-decode each segment if needed in your programming language
  - Apply type-specific normalization to each segment if needed
  - Join segments back with a ‘/’
  - This is the `namespace`

## Known `purl` `qualifiers` key/value pairs

Note: Do not abuse `qualifiers`: it can be tempting to use many
qualifier keys but their usage should be limited to the bare minimum for
proper package identification to ensure that a `purl` stays compact and
readable in most cases.

Additional, separate external attributes stored outside of a `purl` are
the preferred mechanism to convey extra long and optional information
such as a download URL, VCS URL or checksums in an API, database or web
form.

With this warning, the known `key` and `value` defined here are valid
for use in all package types:

- `vers` allows the specification of a version range. The value MUST
  adhere to the `Version Range Specification`. This qualifier is
  mutually exclusive with the `version` component. For example:

  pkg:pypi/django?vers=vers:pypi%2F%3E%3D1.11.0%7C%21%3D1.11.1%7C%3C2.0.0

- `repository_url` is an extra URL for an alternative, non-default
  package repository or registry. When a package does not come from the
  default public package repository for its `type` a `purl` may be
  qualified with this extra URL. The default repository or registry of a
  `type` is documented in the “Registered `purl` types” section.

- `download_url` is an extra URL for a direct package web download URL
  to optionally qualify a `purl`.

- `vcs_url` is an extra URL for a package version control system URL to
  optionally qualify a `purl`. The syntax for this URL should be as
  defined in Python pip or the SPDX specification. See
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/cfa1b9d08903/chapters/3-package-information.md#37-package-download-location

  - TODO: incorporate the details from SPDX here.

- `file_name` is an extra file name of a package archive.

- `checksum` is a qualifier for one or more checksums stored as a
  comma-separated list. Each item in the `value` is in form of
  `lowercase_algorithm:hex_encoded_lowercase_value` such as
  `sha1:ad9503c3e994a4f611a4892f2e67ac82df727086`. For example (with
  checksums truncated for brevity):

  checksum=sha1:ad9503c3e994a4f,sha256:41bf9088b3a1e6c1ef1d

## Tests

To support the language-neutral testing of `purl` implementations, a
test suite is provided as JSON document named `test-suite-data.json`.
This JSON document contains an array of objects. Each object represents
a test with these key/value pairs some of which may not be normalized:

- **purl**: a `purl` string.
- **canonical**: the same `purl` string in canonical, normalized form
- **type**: the `type` corresponding to this `purl`.
- **namespace**: the `namespace` corresponding to this `purl`.
- **name**: the `name` corresponding to this `purl`.
- **version**: the `version` corresponding to this `purl`.
- **qualifiers**: the `qualifiers` corresponding to this `purl` as an
  object of {key: value} qualifier pairs.
- **subpath**: the `subpath` corresponding to this `purl`.
- **is_invalid**: a boolean flag set to true if the test should report
  an error

To test `purl` parsing and building, a tool can use this test suite and
for every listed test object, run these tests:

- parsing the test canonical `purl` then re-building a `purl` from these
  parsed components should return the test canonical `purl`

- parsing the test `purl` should return the components parsed from the
  test canonical `purl`

- parsing the test `purl` then re-building a `purl` from these parsed
  components should return the test canonical `purl`

- building a `purl` from the test components should return the test
  canonical `purl`
