2025-08-13 Wednesday 18:18:27 -- jmhoran@aboutcode.org -- The current process
for generating (and regenerating as needed) the purl-standard.md and
purl-specification.md files is a combination of manual and scripted steps.

- Start with the set of .md files created from the former PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst
  file.
- Update one or more of those .md files as needed in a Visual Studio Code
  instance running locally in a branch of a clone of the purl-spec repo.
- Manually copy the full set of .md files to a separate VSCode instance for a
  local repo running pypandoc.  See, e.g., https://pypi.org/project/pypandoc/.
- Configure the code we've written to choose which compiled .md output we want
  (purl-specification.md or purl-standard.md), the input .md files, and any
  changes needed for heading names and numbers.
- Run the code, vet the output .md, fix what needs fixing, and manually copy
  the output .md back into the local purl-spec VSCode instance.
- After careful vetting etc., commit, push, open a new PR if not already opened,
  advise reviewers that the PR is ready for review, and wait for feedback.
- Repeat when needed.

The process is currently run on Windows using WSL2/Ubuntu-20.04.
